## :smile: About meðŸ˜„
My name is Fabricio Henrique Alves da Silva, I'm 19 years old, I'm from
GoiÃ¢nia (GO). I currently live in my hometown, studying the second period of Analysis and Systems Development. I am currently taking a FULLSTACK course at Danki Code in which I am expanding my knowledge in FrontEnd and looking for new challenges in order to seek new horizons and be innovative so that I can change other people's lives with technology. This is the moment when I confess that I am fascinated by technology and that building a career at T.I has always been my first choice, as I am passionate about software development mainly in the area of applications, games and social networks.ðŸ˜„
